        <p><b>Ingredients:</b>

          <ul>Cooking spray,
          <br>1 tube refrigerated biscuit dough,
          <br>4 ounces uncooked breakfast sausage, casings removed,
          <br>4 large eggs,
          <br>2 slices American cheese, halved</p></ul>
          <p><b>Instructions:</b>

           <ul>1: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350Â°F. Coat the wells of a standard 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
        
            <br><br>2: Press a round of biscuit dough into 4 of the muffin cups. (If you have extra biscuits, save them for another use.) Divide the sausage into 4 portions, use your hands to press each portion into a round, and then place each round in an empty muffin cup. Crack an egg into each of the remaining 4 muffin cups.
        
            <br><br>3: Bake until the eggs are set, the biscuits are golden-brown, and the sausage is cooked through, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove the muffin tin from the oven and cool for about 5 minutes.
        
            <br><br>4: To assemble the sliders, cut each biscuit in half; place the sausage patty on top of the cheese; top with an egg, a piece of cheese, and then add the biscuit top. Serve immediately.

        <br><b>2</b> tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the baking sheet,

        <br><b>8</b> large eggs,
        
        <br>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<ul>
        </p>

          <p>
<br><b>Directions:</b>
<uL><b>1:</b> Make the salsa: Combine the whole tomatoes with their juices, diced tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic, jalapeno, sugar, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the lime juice in a food processor or blender. Pulse several times until it reaches the consistency you like. Set aside.

<br><br><b>2:</b> Prepare the pizza: Place the oven rack in the lowest position and preheat to 475 degrees F. Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until chewy, about 8 minutes; drain on paper towels. Chop into bite-size pieces.

<br><br><b>3:</b> Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a separate large skillet over medium-high heat; add the frozen hash browns and cook, stirring occasionally, until they just start turning golden brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. In the same skillet, fry the red and green peppers in the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over

<br><br><b>4:</b> medium-high heat until they're nice and brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside.

<br><br><b>5:</b> Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Spread 1/2 cup salsa over the dough, then evenly distribute the sliced mozzarella over the salsa. Sprinkle with the hash browns, bell peppers and bacon.

<br><br><b>6:</b> comes the fun part! Make 8 little wells in the filling here and there all over the surface of the pizza; crack the eggs into the wells. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the eggs are set but still slightly soft, about 15 minutes. Cut into large pieces and serve with the remaining salsa.</p></ul>

      <p>
        <b>Ingredients:</b>


<br><br>Butter, for greasing

<br><b>4</b> tablespoons (2 ounces/57 grams) salted butter, melted and cooled

<br><b>2</b> 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces/355 grams) all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)

<br><b>1</b> 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

<br><b>1</b> teaspoon fine salt

<br><b>1/2</b> teaspoon onion powder

<br><b>1</b> cup (8 fluid ounces/225 milliliters) milk

<br><b>1</b> large egg plus 12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled (see Cook's Note)

<br><b>1/2</b> cup (4 ounces/115 grams) sour cream (see Cook's Note)

<br><b>10</b> strips bacon, cooked until crisp then chopped

<br><b>4</b> scallions, thinly sliced

<br><b>2</b> cups (8 ounces/225 grams) shredded Cheddar, (see Cook's Note)
      </p>
      <p>
        
<br><b>Directions:</b>
    <ul><b>1:</b> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously butter a 12-cup muffin pan.
    <br><br><b>2:</b> In a large bowl, whisk to combine the flour, baking powder, salt and onion powder.
    <br><br><b>3:</b> In a pitcher or large measuring cup, combine the milk, raw egg, sour cream and melted butter; whisk until evenly incorporated. Pour into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until a thick batter forms. Fold in the bacon, scallions and Cheddar.
    <br><br><b>4:</b> Using 2 spoons, drop heaped tablespoons of the batter into each cup of the prepared muffin pan. Add 1 hard-boiled egg to the center of each and press down so the egg meets the batter on the bottom of the pan.
    <br><br><b>5:</b> Using the same two spoons, drop heaped tablespoons of batter over each egg, using the spoons to push the batter down to fully encase the egg.
    <br><br><b>6:</b> Bake until the muffins are firm and golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before unmolding the muffins from the pan. Enjoy immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
    <br><br><b>7:</b> Cook's Note: The all-purpose flour can be replaced with a gluten-free all-purpose flour.
    <br><br><b>8:</b> The sour cream can be replaced with yogurt or buttermilk.
    <br><br><b>9:</b> The cheese can be replaced with any shredded cheese of your choice -- or omit the cheese, if desired.
    <br><br><b>10:</b> You can replace the raw egg in this recipe with flax or chia egg. You can also omit the hard- boiled eggs.
    <br><br><b>11:</b> To hard-boil eggs: I like to boil 12 eggs then set them aside while I make the muffin batter. The method I use to hard-boil eggs is fool-proof and it goes like this: Start with a large pot full of cold water. Place your eggs in the water, making sure they are fully submerged. Bring the water to a boil, uncovered, over medium-high heat. This will take 10 to 15 minutes.
    <br><br><b>12:</b> Once the water comes to a rolling boil, remove from the heat and cover the pot. Set your timer for 10 to 12 minutes (longer if youâre boiling a bigger batch of eggs). When the time is up, drain the eggs and run them under tepid water to stop the cooking.
    <br><br><b>13:</b> When the eggs are cool enough to handle, crack them all over and peel while still warm. I promise you, this works like a charm every time.

  <ul>
  <b>1:</b> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with heavy-duty foil, shiny-side up. Spray evenly with cooking spray.

      <ul>
        <b>1:</b> Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook, breaking it up into small pieces, until cooked through and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. 
        <br><br><b>2:</b> Add the hash browns to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are golden brown and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Beat together the eggs, a pinch of salt, a few grinds of pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce in a medium bowl until well blended. Return the chorizo to the pan and pour the eggs over the potatoes and chorizo and cook, stirring, until the eggs are fluffy and just set, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro.
      <br><br><b>3:</b> Working with one tortilla at a time, warm in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat until pliable. Top with one-quarter of the avocado and egg mixture, 1 tablespoon of the pico de gallo and 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Fold in the two sides and roll up tightly from the bottom to the top. Repeat with remaining tortillas and burrito fillings. Serve with the remaining pico de gallo on the side.
